# ðŸŒ± My personal website
This repository contains the code that i use to run my personal website, it is built with vite, react and ChakraUI v2 for JavaScript.

It is also a website built to showcase my learning and developing ability, as this is the first time i have ever built a full website, and it also made me interact with GitHub Actions, which i have never used before.
